Original Filename:  CDIDataImportCronOutdated.md

# CDIDataImportCronOutdated

## Meaning

This alert fires when `DataImportCron` cannot poll or import the latest disk
image versions.

`DataImportCron` polls disk images, checking for the latest versions, and
imports the images into persistent volume claims (PVCs) or VolumeSnapshots. This
process ensures that these sources are updated to the latest version so that
they can be used as reliable clone sources or golden images for virtual machines
(VMs).

For golden images, _latest_ refers to the latest operating system of the
distribution. For other disk images, _latest_ refers to the latest hash of the
image that is available.

**Note:** If the status of a `DataImportCron` PVC is `Pending` because there is
no
default storage class, the `CDIDataImportCronOutdated` alert is suppressed and
the
`CDINoDefaultStorageClass` alert is triggered.

## Impact

VMs might be created from outdated disk images.

VMs might fail to start because no boot source is available for cloning.

## Diagnosis

1. Check the cluster for a default OpenShift Container Platform storage class:
   ```bash
   $ oc get sc -o jsonpath='{.items[?(.metadata.annotations.storageclass\.kubernetes\.io\/is-default-class=="true")].metadata.name}'
   ```

   Check the cluster for a default virtualization storage class:
   ```bash
   $ oc get sc -o jsonpath='{.items[?(.metadata.annotations.storageclass\.kubevirt\.io\/is-default-virt-class=="true")].metadata.name}'
   ```

   The output displays the default (OpenShift Container Platform and/or
virtualization) storage
   class. You must either set a default storage class on the cluster, or ask for
   a specific storage class in the `DataImportCron` specification, in order for
   the `DataImportCron` to poll and import golden images. If the default
   storage class does not exist, the created import DataVolume and PVC will be
   in `Pending` phase.

2. List the `DataImportCron` objects that are not up-to-date:

   ```bash
   $ oc get dataimportcron -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="UpToDate")].status}{"\t"}{.metadata.namespace}{"/"}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}' | grep False
   ```

3. If a default storage class is not defined on the cluster, check the
`DataImportCron` specification for a `DataVolume` template storage class:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n <namespace> get dataimportcron <dataimportcron> -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.storage.storageClassName}{"\n"}'
   ```

4. Obtain the name of the `DataVolume` associated with the `DataImportCron`
object:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n <namespace> get dataimportcron <dataimportcron> -o jsonpath='{.status.lastImportedPVC.name}{"\n"}'
   ```

5. Check the `DataVolume` status:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n <namespace> get dv <datavolume> -o jsonpath-as-json='{.status}'
   ```

6. Set the `CDI_NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export CDI_NAMESPACE="$(oc get deployment -A -o jsonpath='{.items[?(.metadata.name=="cdi-operator")].metadata.namespace}')"
   ```

7. Check the `cdi-deployment` log for error messages:

   ```bash
   $ oc logs -n $CDI_NAMESPACE deployment/cdi-deployment
   ```

## Mitigation

1. Set a default storage class, either on the cluster or in the `DataImportCron`
specification, to poll and import golden images. The updated Containerized Data
Importer (CDI) should resolve the issue within a few seconds.

2. If the issue does not resolve itself, or, if you have changed the default
storage class in the cluster, you must delete the existing boot sources
(data volumes or volume snapshots) in the cluster namespace that are configured
with the previous default storage class. The CDI will recreate the data volumes
with the newly configured default storage class.

3. If your cluster is installed in a restricted network environment, disable the
`enableCommonBootImageImport` feature gate in order to opt out of automatic
updates:

   ```bash
   $ oc patch hco kubevirt-hyperconverged -n $CDI_NAMESPACE --type json -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/featureGates/enableCommonBootImageImport", "value": false}]'
   ```

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,
attaching the artifacts gathered during the diagnosis procedure.

Original Filename:  CDIDataVolumeUnusualRestartCount.md

# CDIDataVolumeUnusualRestartCount

## Meaning

This alert fires when a `DataVolume` object restarts more than three times.

## Impact

Data volumes are responsible for importing and creating a virtual machine disk
on a persistent volume claim. If a data volume restarts more than three times,
these operations are unlikely to succeed. You must diagnose and resolve the
issue.

## Diagnosis

1. Find Containerized Data Importer (CDI) pods with more than three restarts:

   ```bash
   $ oc get pods --all-namespaces -l app=containerized-data-importer -o=jsonpath='{range .items[?(@.status.containerStatuses[0].restartCount>3)]}{.metadata.name}{"/"}{.metadata.namespace}{"\n"}'
   ```

2. Obtain the details of the pods:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n <namespace> describe pods <pod>
   ```

3. Check the pod logs for error messages:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n <namespace> logs <pod>
   ```

## Mitigation

Delete the data volume, resolve the issue, and create a new data volume.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,
attaching the artifacts gathered during the diagnosis procedure.


------------------------------


Original Filename:  CDIDefaultStorageClassDegraded.md

# CDIDefaultStorageClassDegraded

## Meaning

This alert fires if the default storage class does not support smart cloning
(CSI or snapshot-based) or the ReadWriteMany access mode. The alert does not
fire if at least one default storage class supports these features.

A default virtualization storage class has precedence over a default OpenShift
Container Platform
storage class for creating a VirtualMachine disk image.

In case of single-node OpenShift, the alert is suppressed if there is a default
storage class that supports smart cloning, but not ReadWriteMany.

## Impact

If the default storage class does not support smart cloning, the default cloning
method is host-assisted cloning, which is much less efficient.

If the default storage class does not support ReadWriteMany, virtual machines
(VMs) cannot be live migrated.

## Diagnosis

1. Get the default virtualization storage class by running the following
command:

   ```bash
   $ export CDI_DEFAULT_VIRT_SC="$(oc get sc -o jsonpath='{.items[?(.metadata.annotations.storageclass\.kubernetes\.io\/is-default-class=="true")].metadata.name}')"
   ```

2. If a default virtualization storage class exists, check that it supports
ReadWriteMany by running the following command:

   ```bash
   $ oc get storageprofile $CDI_DEFAULT_VIRT_SC -o jsonpath='{.status.claimPropertySets}' | grep ReadWriteMany
   ```

3. If there is no default virtualization storage class, get the default
OpenShift Container Platform storage class by running the following command:

   ```bash
   $ export CDI_DEFAULT_K8S_SC="$(oc get sc -o jsonpath='{.items[?(.metadata.annotations.storageclass\.kubernetes\.io\/is-default-class=="true")].metadata.name}')"
   ```

4. If a default OpenShift Container Platform storage class exists, check that
it supports
ReadWriteMany by running the following command:

   ```bash
   $ oc get storageprofile $CDI_DEFAULT_VIRT_SC -o jsonpath='{.status.claimPropertySets}' | grep ReadWriteMany
   ```

## Mitigation

Ensure that you have a default (OpenShift Container Platform or virtualization)
storage class, and
that the default storage class supports smart cloning and ReadWriteMany.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case, attaching
the artifacts gathered during the diagnosis procedure.


------------------------------


Original Filename:  CDIMultipleDefaultVirtStorageClasses.md

# CDIMultipleDefaultVirtStorageClasses

## Meaning

This alert fires when more than one default virtualization storage class exists.

A default virtualization storage class has precedence over a default OpenShift
Container Platform
storage class for creating a VirtualMachine disk image.

## Impact

If more than one default virtualization storage class exists, a data volume that
requests a default storage class (storage class not explicitly specified),
receives the most recently created one.

## Diagnosis

Obtain a list of default virtualization storage classes by running the following
command:

```bash
$ oc get sc -o jsonpath='{.items[?(.metadata.annotations.storageclass\.kubevirt\.io\/is-default-virt-class=="true")].metadata.name}'
```

## Mitigation

Ensure that only one storage class has the default virtualization storage class
annotation.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,
attaching the artifacts gathered during the diagnosis procedure.


------------------------------


Original Filename:  CDINoDefaultStorageClass.md

# CDINoDefaultStorageClass

## Meaning

This alert fires when a data volume is `Pending` because there is no default
storage class.

A default virtualization storage class has precedence over a default OpenShift
Container Platform
storage class for creating a VirtualMachine disk image.

## Impact

If there is no default OpenShift Container Platform storage class and no
default virtualization
storage class, a data volume that does not have a specified storage class
remains in a `Pending` phase.

## Diagnosis

1. Check for a default OpenShift Container Platform storage class by running
the following
command:

  ```bash
  $ oc get sc -o jsonpath='{.items[?(.metadata.annotations.storageclass\.kubernetes\.io\/is-default-class=="true")].metadata.name}'
  ```

2. Check for a default virtualization storage class by running the following
command:

  ```bash
  $ oc get sc -o jsonpath='{.items[?(.metadata.annotations.storageclass\.kubevirt\.io\/is-default-virt-class=="true")].metadata.name}'
  ```

## Mitigation

Create a default storage class for OpenShift Container Platform,
virtualization, or both.

A default virtualization storage class has precedence over a default OpenShift
Container Platform
storage class for creating a virtual machine disk image.

* Create a default OpenShift Container Platform storage class by running the
following command:

  ```bash
  $ oc patch storageclass <storage-class-name> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
  ```

* Create a default virtualization storage class by running the following
command:

  ```bash
  $ oc patch storageclass <storage-class-name> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubevirt.io/is-default-virt-class":"true"}}}'
  ```

Original Filename:  CDINotReady.md

# CDINotReady

## Meaning

This alert fires when the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) is in a degraded
state:

- Not progressing
- Not available to use

## Impact

CDI is not usable, so users cannot build virtual machine disks on persistent
volume claims (PVCs) using CDI's data volumes. CDI components are not ready, and
they stopped progressing towards a ready state.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `CDI_NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export CDI_NAMESPACE="$(oc get deployment -A | grep cdi-operator | awk '{print $1}')"
   ```

2. Check the CDI deployment for components that are not ready:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $CDI_NAMESPACE get deploy -l cdi.kubevirt.io
   ```

3. Check the details of the failing pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $CDI_NAMESPACE describe pods <pod>
   ```

4. Check the logs of the failing pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $CDI_NAMESPACE logs <pod>
   ```

## Mitigation

Try to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,
attaching the artifacts gathered during the diagnosis procedure.

Original Filename:  CDIOperatorDown.md

# CDIOperatorDown

## Meaning

This alert fires when the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) Operator is down.
The CDI Operator deploys and manages the CDI infrastructure components, such as
data volume and persistent volume claim (PVC) controllers. These controllers
help users build virtual machine disks on PVCs.

## Impact

The CDI components might fail to deploy or to stay in a required state. The CDI
installation might not function correctly.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `CDI_NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export CDI_NAMESPACE="$(oc get deployment -A | grep cdi-operator | awk '{print $1}')"
   ```

2. Check whether the `cdi-operator` pod is currently running:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $CDI_NAMESPACE get pods -l name=cdi-operator
   ```

3. Obtain the details of the `cdi-operator` pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $CDI_NAMESPACE describe pods -l name=cdi-operator
   ```

4. Check the log of the `cdi-operator` pod for errors:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $CDI_NAMESPACE logs -l name=cdi-operator
   ```

## Mitigation

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,

------------------------------


Original Filename:  CDIStorageProfilesIncomplete.md

# CDIStorageProfilesIncomplete

## Meaning

This alert fires when a Containerized Data Importer (CDI) storage profile is
incomplete.

If a storage profile is incomplete, the CDI cannot infer persistent volume claim
(PVC) fields, such as `volumeMode` and  `accessModes`, which are required to
create a virtual machine (VM) disk.

## Impact

The CDI cannot create a VM disk on the PVC.

## Diagnosis

- Identify the incomplete storage profile:

  ```bash
  $ oc get storageprofile <storage_class>
  ```

## Mitigation

- Add the missing storage profile information:

  ```bash
  $ oc patch storageprofile local --type=merge -p '{"spec": \
    {"claimPropertySets": [{"accessModes": ["ReadWriteOnce"], \
    "volumeMode": "Filesystem"}]}}'
  ```

------------------------------


Original Filename:  CnaoDown.md

# CnaoDown

## Meaning

This alert fires when the Cluster Network Addons Operator (CNAO) is down.
The CNAO deploys additional networking components on top of the cluster.

## Impact

If the CNAO is not running, the cluster cannot reconcile changes to virtual
machine components. As a result, the changes might fail to take effect.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get deployment -A | grep cluster-network-addons-operator | awk '{print $1}')"
   ```

2. Check the status of the `cluster-network-addons-operator` pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE get pods -l name=cluster-network-addons-operator
   ```

3. Check the `cluster-network-addons-operator` logs for error messages:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE logs -l name=cluster-network-addons-operator
   ```

4. Obtain the details of the `cluster-network-addons-operator` pods:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE describe pods -l name=cluster-network-addons-operator
   ```

------------------------------


Original Filename:  CnaoNmstateMigration.md

# CnaoNmstateMigration

## Meaning

This alert fires when a `kubernetes-nmstate` deployment is detected and the
OpenShift Container Platform NMState Operator is not installed. This alert only
affects OpenShift
Virtualization 4.10.

The Cluster Network Addons Operator (CNAO) does not support `kubernetes-nmstate`
deployments in OpenShift Virtualization 4.11 and later.

## Impact

You cannot upgrade your cluster to OpenShift Virtualization 4.11.

## Mitigation

Install the OpenShift Container Platform NMState Operator from the OperatorHub.
CNAO automatically
transfers the `kubernetes-nmstate` deployment to the Operator.

Afterwards, you can upgrade to OpenShift Virtualization 4.11.


------------------------------


Original Filename:  HCOInstallationIncomplete.md

# HCOInstallationIncomplete

## Meaning
This alert fires when the HyperConverged Cluster Operator (HCO) runs for more
than an hour without a `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

This alert has the following causes:

- During the installation process, you installed the HCO but you did not create
the `HyperConverged` CR.
- During the uninstall process, you removed the `HyperConverged` CR before
uninstalling the HCO and the HCO is still running.

## Mitigation

The mitigation depends on whether you are installing or uninstalling
the HCO:

- Complete the installation by creating a `HyperConverged` CR with its
default values:

  ```bash
  $ cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
  apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
  kind: HyperConverged
  metadata:
    name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
    namespace: openshift-cnv
  spec: {}
  EOF
  ```

- Uninstall the HCO. If the uninstall process continues to run, you must
resolve that issue in order to cancel the alert.


------------------------------


Original Filename:  HCOMisconfiguredDescheduler.md

# HCOMisconfiguredDescheduler

## Meaning

A descheduler is a OpenShift Container Platform application that causes the
control plane to
re-arrange the workloads in a better way.

The descheduler uses the OpenShift Container Platform eviction API to evict
pods, and receives
feedback from `kube-api` on whether the eviction request was granted.
In contrast, to keep a VM live and trigger a live migration,
OpenShift Virtualization handles eviction requests in a custom manner,
and a live migration takes time to perform.

Therefore, when a `virt-launcher` pod is migrating to another node in the
background,
the descheduler detects this as a pod that failed to be evicted. As a
consequence,
the manner in which OpenShift Virtualization handles eviction requests causes
the descheduler
to make incorrect decisions and take incorrect actions that might destabilize
the cluster.

To correctly handle the special case of an evicted VM pod triggering a live
migration to another node, the `Kube Descheduler Operator` introduced
a `profileCustomizations` named `devEnableEvictionsInBackground`.
This is currently considered an `alpha` feature for
on `Kube Descheduler Operator`.

## Impact

Using the descheduler operator for KubeVirt VMs without the
`devEnableEvictionsInBackground` profile customization might lead
to unstable or unpredictable behavior, which negatively impacts cluster
stability.

## Diagnosis

1. Check the CR for `Kube Descheduler Operator`:

   ```bash
   $ oc get -n openshift-kube-descheduler-operator KubeDescheduler cluster -o yaml
   ```

2. Search for the following lines in the CR:

   ```yaml
   spec:
      profileCustomizations:
         devEnableEvictionsInBackground: true
   ```

If these lines are not present, the `Kube Descheduler Operator` is not
correctly configured
to work alongside OpenShift Virtualization.

## Mitigation

Do one of the following:

* Add the following lines to the CR for `Kube Descheduler Operator`:
   ```yaml
   spec:
      profileCustomizations:
         devEnableEvictionsInBackground: true
   ```

* Remove the `Kube Descheduler Operator`.

Note that `EvictionsInBackground` is an alpha feature,
and as such, it is provided as an experimental feature
and is subject to change.

Original Filename:  HCOOperatorConditionsUnhealthy.md

# HCOOperatorConditionsUnhealthy

## Meaning

This alert triggers when the HCO operator conditions or its secondary resources
are in an error or warning state.

## Impact

Resources maintained by the operator might not be functioning correctly.

## Diagnosis

Check the operator conditions:

```bash
oc get HyperConverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n kubevirt -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions}'
```

## Mitigation

Based on the information obtained during the diagnosis procedure, try to
identify the root cause within the operator or any of its secondary resources,
and resolve the issue.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,

Original Filename:  HPPNotReady.md

# HPPNotReady

## Meaning

This alert fires when a hostpath provisioner (HPP) installation is in a degraded
state.

The HPP dynamically provisions hostpath volumes to provide storage for
persistent volume claims (PVCs).

## Impact

HPP is not usable. Its components are not ready and they are not progressing
towards a ready state.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `HPP_NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export HPP_NAMESPACE="$(oc get deployment -A | grep hostpath-provisioner-operator | awk '{print $1}')"
   ```

2. Check for HPP components that are currently not ready:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $HPP_NAMESPACE get all -l k8s-app=hostpath-provisioner
   ```

3. Obtain the details of the failing pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $HPP_NAMESPACE describe pods <pod>
   ```

4. Check the logs of the failing pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $HPP_NAMESPACE logs <pod>
   ```

------------------------------


Original Filename:  HPPOperatorDown.md

# HPPOperatorDown

## Meaning

This alert fires when the hostpath provisioner (HPP) Operator is down.

The HPP Operator deploys and manages the HPP infrastructure components, such as
the daemon set that provisions hostpath volumes.

## Impact

The HPP components might fail to deploy or to remain in the required state. As a
result, the HPP installation might not work correctly in the cluster.

## Diagnosis

1. Configure the `HPP_NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ HPP_NAMESPACE="$(oc get deployment -A | grep hostpath-provisioner-operator | awk '{print $1}')"
   ```

2. Check whether the `hostpath-provisioner-operator` pod is currently running:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $HPP_NAMESPACE get pods -l name=hostpath-provisioner-operator
   ```

3. Obtain the details of the `hostpath-provisioner-operator` pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $HPP_NAMESPACE describe pods -l name=hostpath-provisioner-operator
   ```

4. Check the log of the `hostpath-provisioner-operator` pod for errors:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $HPP_NAMESPACE logs -l name=hostpath-provisioner-operator
   ```

## Mitigation

Based on the information obtained during the diagnosis procedure, try to
identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

------------------------------


Original Filename:  HPPSharingPoolPathWithOS.md

# HPPSharingPoolPathWithOS

## Meaning

This alert fires when the hostpath provisioner (HPP) shares a file system with
other critical components, such as `kubelet` or the operating system (OS).

HPP dynamically provisions hostpath volumes to provide storage for persistent
volume claims (PVCs).

## Impact

A shared hostpath pool puts pressure on the node's disks. The node might have
degraded performance and stability.

## Diagnosis

1. Configure the `HPP_NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export HPP_NAMESPACE="$(oc get deployment -A | grep hostpath-provisioner-operator | awk '{print $1}')"
   ```

2. Obtain the status of the `hostpath-provisioner-csi` daemon set pods:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $HPP_NAMESPACE get pods | grep hostpath-provisioner-csi
   ```

3. Check the `hostpath-provisioner-csi` logs to identify the shared pool and
path:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $HPP_NAMESPACE logs <csi_daemonset> -c hostpath-provisioner
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   I0208 15:21:03.769731       1 utils.go:221] pool (<legacy, csi-data-dir>/csi), shares path with OS which can lead to node disk pressure
   ```

## Mitigation

Using the data obtained in the Diagnosis section, try to prevent the pool path
from being shared with the OS. The specific steps vary based on the node and
other circumstances.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,
attaching the artifacts gathered during the diagnosis procedure.


------------------------------


Original Filename:  KubeMacPoolDuplicateMacsFound.md

# KubeMacPoolDuplicateMacsFound

## Meaning

This alert fires when `KubeMacPool` detects duplicate MAC addresses.

`KubeMacPool` is responsible for allocating MAC addresses and preventing MAC
address conflicts. When `KubeMacPool` starts, it scans the cluster for the MAC
addresses of virtual machines (VMs) in managed namespaces.

## Impact

Duplicate MAC addresses on the same LAN might cause network issues.

## Diagnosis

1. Obtain the namespace and the name of the `kubemacpool-mac-controller` pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc get pod -A -l control-plane=mac-controller-manager --no-headers \
     -o custom-columns=":metadata.namespace,:metadata.name"
   ```
2. Obtain the duplicate MAC addresses from the `kubemacpool-mac-controller`
logs:

   ```bash
   $ oc logs -n <namespace> <kubemacpool_mac_controller> | grep "already allocated"
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   mac address 02:00:ff:ff:ff:ff already allocated to vm/kubemacpool-test/testvm, br1,
   conflict with: vm/kubemacpool-test/testvm2, br1
   ```

## Mitigation

1. Update the VMs to remove the duplicate MAC addresses.
2. Restart the `kubemacpool-mac-controller` pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc delete pod -n <namespace> <kubemacpool_mac_controller>
   ```


------------------------------


Original Filename:  KubeVirtCRModified.md

# KubeVirtCRModified

## Meaning

This alert fires when an operand of the HyperConverged Cluster Operator (HCO) is
changed by someone or something other than HCO.

HCO configures OpenShift Virtualization and its supporting operators in an
opinionated way and
overwrites its operands when there is an unexpected change to them. Users must
not modify the operands directly. The `HyperConverged` custom resource is the
source of truth for the configuration.

## Impact

Changing the operands manually causes the cluster configuration to fluctuate and
might lead to instability.

## Diagnosis

- Check the `component_name` value in the alert details to determine the operand
  kind (`kubevirt`) and the operand name (`kubevirt-kubevirt-hyperconverged`)
  that are being changed:

  ```text
  Labels
    alertname=KubeVirtCRModified
    component_name=kubevirt/kubevirt-kubevirt-hyperconverged
    severity=warning
  ```

## Mitigation

Do not change the HCO operands directly. Use `HyperConverged` objects to
configure the cluster.

The alert resolves itself after 10 minutes if the operands are not changed
manually.

# KubeVirtComponentExceedsRequestedMemory [Deprecated]

This alert is deprecated. You can safely ignore or silence it.



------------------------------


Original Filename:  KubeVirtDeprecatedAPIRequested.md

# KubeVirtDeprecatedAPIRequested

## Meaning

This alert fires when a deprecated `KubeVirt` API is used.

## Impact

Using a deprecated API is not recommended because the request will
fail when the API is removed in a future release.

## Diagnosis

- Check the __Description__ and __Summary__ sections of the alert to identify
the
  deprecated API as in the following example:

  __Description__

  `Detected requests to the deprecated virtualmachines.kubevirt.io/v1alpha3 API.`

  __Summary__

  `2 requests were detected in the last 10 minutes.`

## Mitigation

Use fully supported APIs. The alert resolves itself after 10 minutes if the
deprecated API is not used.


------------------------------


Original Filename:  KubeVirtNoAvailableNodesToRunVMs.md

# KubeVirtNoAvailableNodesToRunVMs

## Meaning

The `KubeVirtNoAvailableNodesToRunVMs` alert is triggered when all nodes in the
OpenShift Container Platform cluster are missing hardware virtualization or CPU
virtualization
extensions. This means that the cluster does not have the necessary hardware
support to run virtual machines (VMs).

## Impact

If this alert is triggered, it means that VMs will not be able to run on the
cluster. This can have a significant impact on the operations of the cluster, as
VMs may be used for critical applications or services.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this alert, the following steps can be taken:

1. Check the hardware configuration of the nodes in the cluster. Make sure that
all nodes have hardware virtualization or CPU virtualization extensions
enabled.

2. Check the node labels in the cluster. Make sure that nodes with the necessary
hardware support are labeled as such, so that VMs can be scheduled to run on
these nodes.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the impact of this alert, add nodes to the cluster that have
hardware virtualization or CPU virtualization extensions enabled.

Original Filename:  KubeVirtVMIExcessiveMigrations.md

# KubeVirtVMIExcessiveMigrations

## Meaning

This alert fires when a virtual machine instance (VMI) live migrates more than
12 times over a period of 24 hours.

This migration rate is abnormally high, even during an upgrade. This alert might
indicate a problem in the cluster infrastructure, such as network disruptions or
insufficient resources.

## Impact

A virtual machine (VM) that migrates too frequently might experience degraded
performance because memory page faults occur during the transition.

## Diagnosis

1. Verify that the worker node has sufficient resources:

   ```bash
   $ oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker= -o json | jq .items[].status.allocatable
   ```

   Example output:

   ```json
   {
     "cpu": "3500m",
     "devices.kubevirt.io/kvm": "1k",
     "devices.kubevirt.io/sev": "0",
     "devices.kubevirt.io/tun": "1k",
     "devices.kubevirt.io/vhost-net": "1k",
     "ephemeral-storage": "38161122446",
     "hugepages-1Gi": "0",
     "hugepages-2Mi": "0",
     "memory": "7000128Ki",
     "pods": "250"
   }
   ```

2. Check the status of the worker node:

   ```bash
   $ oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker= -o json | jq .items[].status.conditions
   ```

   Example output:

   ```json
   {
     "lastHeartbeatTime": "2022-05-26T07:36:01Z",
     "lastTransitionTime": "2022-05-23T08:12:02Z",
     "message": "kubelet has sufficient memory available",
     "reason": "KubeletHasSufficientMemory",
     "status": "False",
     "type": "MemoryPressure"
   },
   {

     "lastTransitionTime": "2022-05-23T08:12:02Z",
     "message": "kubelet has no disk pressure",
     "reason": "KubeletHasNoDiskPressure",
     "status": "False",
     "type": "DiskPressure"
   },
   {
     "lastHeartbeatTime": "2022-05-26T07:36:01Z",
     "lastTransitionTime": "2022-05-23T08:12:02Z",
     "message": "kubelet has sufficient PID available",
     "reason": "KubeletHasSufficientPID",

     "lastTransitionTime": "2022-05-23T08:24:15Z",
     "message": "kubelet is posting ready status",
     "reason": "KubeletReady",
     "status": "True",
     "type": "Ready"
   }
   ```

3. Log in to the worker node and verify that the `kubelet` service is running:

   ```bash
   $ systemctl status kubelet
   ```

4. Check the `kubelet` journal log for error messages:

   ```bash
   $ journalctl -r -u kubelet
   ```

## Mitigation

Ensure that the worker nodes have sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk) to
run VM workloads without interruption.

If the problem persists, try to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,

Original Filename:  KubemacpoolDown.md

# KubemacpoolDown

## Meaning

`KubeMacPool` is down. `KubeMacPool` is responsible for allocating MAC addresses
and preventing MAC address conflicts.

## Impact

If `KubeMacPool` is down, `VirtualMachine` objects cannot be created.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `KMP_NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export KMP_NAMESPACE="$(oc get pod -A --no-headers -l \
      control-plane=mac-controller-manager | awk '{print $1}')"
   ```

2. Set the `KMP_NAME` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export KMP_NAME="$(oc get pod -A --no-headers -l \
      control-plane=mac-controller-manager | awk '{print $2}')"
   ```

3. Obtain the `KubeMacPool-manager` pod details:

   ```bash
   $ oc describe pod -n $KMP_NAMESPACE $KMP_NAME
   ```

4. Check the `KubeMacPool-manager` logs for error messages:

   ```bash
   $ oc logs -n $KMP_NAMESPACE $KMP_NAME
   ```

## Mitigation

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the

Original Filename:  KubevirtVmHighMemoryUsage.md

# KubevirtVmHighMemoryUsage

## Meaning

This alert fires when a container hosting a virtual machine (VM) has less than
20 MB free memory.

## Impact

The virtual machine running inside the container is terminated by the runtime
if the container's memory limit is exceeded.

## Diagnosis

1. Obtain the `virt-launcher` pod details:

   ```bash
   $ oc get pod <virt-launcher> -o yaml
   ```

2. Identify `compute` container processes with high memory usage in the
`virt-launcher` pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc exec -it <virt-launcher> -c compute -- top
   ```

## Mitigation

- Increase the memory limit in the `VirtualMachine` specification as in the
following example:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     running: false
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           kubevirt.io/vm: vm-name
       spec:
         domain:
           resources:
             limits:
               memory: 200Mi
             requests:
               memory: 128Mi
   ```


------------------------------


Original Filename:  LowKVMNodesCount.md

# LowKVMNodesCount

## Meaning

This alert fires when fewer than two nodes in the cluster have KVM resources.

## Impact

The cluster must have at least two nodes with KVM resources for live migration.

Virtual machines cannot be scheduled or run if no nodes have KVM resources.

## Diagnosis

- Identify the nodes with KVM resources:

  ```bash
  $ oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.allocatable}' | grep devices.kubevirt.io/kvm
  ```

## Mitigation

Install KVM on the nodes without KVM resources.


------------------------------


Original Filename:  LowReadyVirtControllersCount.md

# LowReadyVirtControllersCount

## Meaning

This alert fires when one or more `virt-controller` pods are running, but none
of these pods has been in the `Ready` state for the last 5 minutes.

A `virt-controller` device monitors the custom resource definitions (CRDs) of a
virtual machine instance (VMI) and manages the associated pods. The device
create pods for VMIs and manages the lifecycle of the pods. The device is
critical for cluster-wide virtualization functionality.

## Impact

This alert indicates that a cluster-level failure might occur, which would cause
actions related to VM lifecycle management to fail. This notably includes
launching a new VMI or shutting down an existing VMI.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. Verify a `virt-controller` device is available:

   ```bash
   $ oc get deployment -n $NAMESPACE virt-controller -o jsonpath='{.status.readyReplicas}'
   ```

3. Check the status of the `virt-controller` deployment:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE get deploy virt-controller -o yaml
   ```

4. Obtain the details of the `virt-controller` deployment to check for status
conditions, such as crashing pods or failures to pull images:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE describe deploy virt-controller
   ```

5. Check if any problems occurred with the nodes. For example, they might be in
a `NotReady` state:

   ```bash
   $ oc get nodes
   ```

## Mitigation

This alert can have multiple causes, including the following:

- The cluster has insufficient memory.
- The nodes are down.
- The API server is overloaded. For example, the scheduler might be under a
heavy load and therefore not completely available.
- There are network issues.

Try to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,

Original Filename:  LowReadyVirtOperatorsCount.md

# LowReadyVirtOperatorsCount

## Meaning

This alert fires when one or more `virt-operator` pods are running, but none of
these pods has been in a `Ready` state for the last 10 minutes.

The `virt-operator` is the first Operator to start in a cluster. The
`virt-operator` deployment has a default replica of two `virt-operator` pods.

Its primary responsibilities include the following:

- Installing, live-updating, and live-upgrading a cluster
- Monitoring the lifecycle of top-level controllers, such as `virt-controller`,
`virt-handler`, `virt-launcher`, and managing their reconciliation
- Certain cluster-wide tasks, such as certificate rotation and infrastructure
management

## Impact

A cluster-level failure might occur. Critical cluster-wide management
functionalities, such as certification rotation, upgrade, and reconciliation of
controllers, might become unavailable. Such a state also triggers the
`NoReadyVirtOperator` alert.

The `virt-operator` is not directly responsible for virtual machines (VMs) in
the cluster. Therefore, its temporary unavailability does not significantly
affect VM workloads.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. Obtain the name of the `virt-operator` deployment:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE get deploy virt-operator -o yaml
   ```

3. Obtain the details of the `virt-operator` deployment:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE describe deploy virt-operator
   ```

4. Check for node issues, such as a `NotReady` state:

   ```bash
   $ oc get nodes
   ```

## Mitigation

Based on the information obtained during the diagnosis procedure, try to
identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,
attaching the artifacts gathered during the diagnosis procedure.

Original Filename:  LowVirtAPICount.md

# LowVirtAPICount

## Meaning

This alert fires when only one available `virt-api` pod is detected during a
60-minute period, although at least two nodes are available for scheduling.

## Impact

An API call outage might occur during node eviction because the `virt-api` pod
becomes a single point of failure.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. Check the number of available `virt-api` pods:

   ```bash
   $ oc get deployment -n $NAMESPACE virt-api -o jsonpath='{.status.readyReplicas}'
   ```

3. Check the status of the `virt-api` deployment for error conditions:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE get deploy virt-api -o yaml
   ```

4. Check the nodes for issues such as nodes in a `NotReady` state:

   ```bash
   $ oc get nodes
   ```

## Mitigation

Try to identify the root cause and to resolve the issue.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,

------------------------------


Original Filename:  LowVirtControllersCount.md

# LowVirtControllersCount

## Meaning

This alert fires when a low number of `virt-controller` pods is detected. At
least one `virt-controller` pod must be available in order to ensure high
availability. The default number of replicas is 2.

A `virt-controller` device monitors the custom resource definitions (CRDs) of a
virtual machine instance (VMI) and manages the associated pods. The device
create pods for VMIs and manages the lifecycle of the pods. The device is
critical for cluster-wide virtualization functionality.

## Impact

The responsiveness of OpenShift Virtualization might become negatively
affected. For example,
certain requests might be missed.

In addition, if another `virt-launcher` instance terminates unexpectedly,
OpenShift Virtualization might become completely unresponsive.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. Verify that running `virt-controller` pods are available:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE get pods -l kubevirt.io=virt-controller
   ```

3. Check the `virt-launcher` logs for error messages:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE logs <virt-launcher>
   ```

4. Obtain the details of the `virt-launcher` pod to check for status conditions
such as unexpected termination or a `NotReady` state.

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE describe pod/<virt-launcher>
   ```

## Mitigation

This alert can have a variety of causes, including:

- Not enough memory on the cluster
- Nodes are down
- The API server is overloaded. For example, the scheduler might be under a
heavy load and therefore not completely available.
- Networking issues

Identify the root cause and fix it, if possible.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,

Original Filename:  LowVirtOperatorCount.md

# LowVirtOperatorCount

## Meaning

This alert fires when only one `virt-operator` pod in a `Ready` state has been
running for the last 60 minutes.

The `virt-operator` is the first Operator to start in a cluster. Its primary
responsibilities include the following:

- Installing, live-updating, and live-upgrading a cluster
- Monitoring the lifecycle of top-level controllers, such as `virt-controller`,
`virt-handler`, `virt-launcher`, and managing their reconciliation
- Certain cluster-wide tasks, such as certificate rotation and infrastructure
management

## Impact

The `virt-operator` cannot provide high availability (HA) for the deployment. HA
requires two or more `virt-operator` pods in a `Ready` state. The default
deployment is two pods.

The `virt-operator` is not directly responsible for virtual machines (VMs) in
the cluster. Therefore, its decreased availability does not significantly affect
VM workloads.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. Check the states of the `virt-operator` pods:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE get pods -l kubevirt.io=virt-operator
   ```

3. Review the logs of the affected `virt-operator` pods:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE logs <virt-operator>
   ```

4. Obtain the details of the affected `virt-operator` pods:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE describe pod <virt-operator>
   ```

Original Filename:  NetworkAddonsConfigNotReady.md

# NetworkAddonsConfigNotReady

## Meaning

This alert fires when the `NetworkAddonsConfig` custom resource (CR) of the
Cluster Network Addons Operator (CNAO) is not ready.

CNAO deploys additional networking components on the cluster. This alert
indicates that one of the deployed components is not ready.

## Impact

Network functionality is affected.

## Diagnosis

1. Check the status conditions of the `NetworkAddonsConfig` CR to identify the
deployment or daemon set that is not ready:

   ```bash
   $ oc get networkaddonsconfig -o custom-columns="":.status.conditions[*].message
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   DaemonSet "cluster-network-addons/macvtap-cni" update is being processed...
   ```

2. Check the component's pod for errors:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n cluster-network-addons get daemonset <pod> -o yaml
   ```

3. Check the component's logs:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n cluster-network-addons logs <pod>
   ```

4. Check the component's details for error conditions:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n cluster-network-addons describe <pod>
   ```

## Mitigation

Original Filename:  NoLeadingVirtOperator.md

# NoLeadingVirtOperator

## Meaning

This alert fires when no `virt-operator` pod with a leader lease has been
detected for 10 minutes, although the `virt-operator` pods are in a `Ready`
state. The alert indicates that no leader pod is available.

The `virt-operator` is the first Operator to start in a cluster. Its primary
responsibilities include the following:

- Installing, live updating, and live upgrading a cluster

- Monitoring the lifecycle of top-level controllers, such as `virt-controller`,
`virt-handler`, `virt-launcher`, and managing their reconciliation

- Certain cluster-wide tasks, such as certificate rotation and infrastructure
management

The `virt-operator` deployment has a default replica of 2 pods, with one pod
holding a leader lease.

## Impact

This alert indicates a failure at the level of the cluster. As a result,
critical cluster-wide management functionalities, such as certification
rotation, upgrade, and reconciliation of controllers, might not be available.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. Obtain the status of the `virt-operator` pods:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE get pods -l kubevirt.io=virt-operator
   ```

3. Check the `virt-operator` pod logs to determine the leader status:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE logs | grep lead
   ```

   Leader pod example:

   ```text
   {"component":"virt-operator","level":"info","msg":"Attempting to acquire leader status","pos":"application.go:400","timestamp":"2021-11-30T12:15:18.635387Z"}

Original Filename:  NoReadyVirtController.md

# NoReadyVirtController

## Meaning

This alert fires when no available `virt-controller` devices have been detected
for 5 minutes.

The `virt-controller` devices monitor the custom resource definitions of virtual
machine instances (VMIs) and manage the associated pods. The devices create pods
for VMIs and manage the lifecycle of the pods.

Therefore, `virt-controller` devices are critical for all cluster-wide
virtualization functionality.

## Impact
Any actions related to VM lifecycle management fail. This notably includes
launching a new VMI or shutting down an existing VMI.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

------------------------------


Original Filename:  OrphanedVirtualMachineInstances.md

# OrphanedVirtualMachineInstances

## Meaning

This alert fires when a virtual machine instance (VMI), or `virt-launcher` pod,
runs on a node that does not have a running `virt-handler` pod. Such a VMI is
called _orphaned_.

## Impact

Orphaned VMIs cannot be managed.

## Diagnosis

1. Check the status of the `virt-handler` pods to view the nodes on which they
are running:

   ```bash
   $ oc get pods --all-namespaces -o wide -l kubevirt.io=virt-handler
   ```

2. Check the status of the VMIs to identify VMIs running on nodes that do not
have a running `virt-handler` pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc get vmis --all-namespaces
   ```

3. Check the status of the `virt-handler` daemon:

   ```bash
   $ oc get daemonset virt-handler --all-namespaces
   ```

   Example output:

   ```text
   NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR            AGE
   virt-handler          2         2         2       2            2           kubernetes.io/os=linux   4h
   ```

   The daemon set is considered healthy if the `Desired`, `Ready`, and
   `Available` columns contain the same value.

4. If the `virt-handler` daemon set is not healthy, check the `virt-handler`
daemon set for pod deployment issues:

   ```bash
   $ oc get daemonset virt-handler --all-namespaces -o yaml | jq .status
   ```

5. Check the nodes for issues such as a `NotReady` status:

   ```bash
   $ oc get nodes
   ```

6. Check the `spec.workloads` stanza of the `KubeVirt` custom resource (CR) for
a workloads placement policy:

   ```bash
   $ oc get kubevirt kubevirt --all-namespaces -o yaml
   ```

## Mitigation

If a workloads placement policy is configured, add the node with the VMI to the
policy.

Possible causes for the removal of a `virt-handler` pod from a node include
changes to the node's taints and tolerations or to a pod's scheduling rules.

Try to identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,

Original Filename:  OutdatedVirtualMachineInstanceWorkloads.md

# OutdatedVirtualMachineInstanceWorkloads

## Meaning

This alert fires when running virtual machine instances (VMIs) in outdated
`virt-launcher` pods are detected 24 hours after the OpenShift Virtualization
control plane has
been updated.

## Impact

Outdated VMIs might not have access to new OpenShift Virtualization features.

Outdated VMIs will not receive the security fixes associated with the
`virt-launcher` pod update.

## Diagnosis

1. Identify the outdated VMIs:

   ```bash
   $ oc get vmi -l kubevirt.io/outdatedLauncherImage --all-namespaces
   ```

2. Check the `KubeVirt` custom resource (CR) to determine whether
`workloadUpdateMethods` is configured in the `workloadUpdateStrategy` stanza:

   ```bash
   $ oc get kubevirt --all-namespaces -o yaml
   ```

3. Check each outdated VMI to determine whether it is live-migratable:

   ```bash
   $ oc get vmi <vmi> -o yaml
   ```

   Example output:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
   kind: VirtualMachineInstance
   ...
     status:
       conditions:
       - lastProbeTime: null
         lastTransitionTime: null
         message: cannot migrate VMI which does not use masquerade to connect to the pod network
         reason: InterfaceNotLiveMigratable
         status: "False"
         type: LiveMigratable
   ```

## Mitigation

### Configuring automated workload updates

Update the `HyperConverged` CR to enable automatic workload updates.

### Stopping a VM associated with a non-live-migratable VMI

If a VMI is not live-migratable and if `runStrategy: always` is set in the
corresponding `VirtualMachine` object, you can update the VMI by manually
stopping the virtual machine (VM):

  ```bash
  $ virtctl stop --namespace <namespace> <vm>
  ```

A new VMI spins up immediately in an updated `virt-launcher` pod to replace the
stopped VMI. This is the equivalent of a restart action.

Note: Manually stopping a _live-migratable_ VM is destructive and not
recommended because it interrupts the workload.

### Migrating a live-migratable VMI

If a VMI is live-migratable, you can update it by creating a
`VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` object that targets a specific running VMI.
The VMI is migrated into an updated `virt-launcher` pod.

1. Create a `VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` manifest and save it as
`migration.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
   kind: VirtualMachineInstanceMigration
   metadata:
     name: <migration_name>
     namespace: <namespace>
   spec:
     vmiName: <vmi_name>
   ```

2. Create a `VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` object to trigger the migration:

   ```bash
   $ oc create -f migration.yaml
   ```

Original Filename:  SSPCommonTemplatesModificationReverted.md

# SSPCommonTemplatesModificationReverted

## Meaning

This alert fires when the Scheduling, Scale, and Performance (SSP) Operator
reverts changes to common templates as part of its reconciliation procedure.

The SSP Operator deploys and reconciles the common templates and the Template
Validator. If a user or script changes a common template, the changes are
reverted by the SSP Operator.

## Impact

Changes to common templates are overwritten.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get deployment -A | grep ssp-operator | awk '{print $1}')"
   ```

2. Check the `ssp-operator` logs for templates with reverted changes:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE logs --tail=-1 -l control-plane=ssp-operator | grep 'common template' -C 3
   ```

## Mitigation

Try to identify and resolve the cause of the changes.

Ensure that changes are made only to copies of templates, and not to the
templates themselves.

Original Filename:  SSPTemplateValidatorDown.md

# SSPTemplateValidatorDown

## Meaning

This alert fires when all the Template Validator pods are down.

The Template Validator checks virtual machines (VMs) to ensure that they do not
violate their templates.

## Impact

VMs are not validated against their templates. As a result, VMs might be created
with specifications that do not match their respective workloads.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

Original Filename:  SingleStackIPv6Unsupported.md

# SingleStackIPv6Unsupported

## Meaning

This alert fires when user tries to install OpenShift Virtualization on a single
stack IPv6 cluster.

OpenShift Virtualization is not yet supported on an OpenShift cluster configured
with single stack IPv6. It's progress is being tracked on [this
issue](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-28924).

## Impact

OpenShift Virtualization Operator can't be installed on a single stack IPv6
cluster, and hence creation virtual machines on top of such a cluster is not
possible.

## Diagnosis

- Check the cluster network configuration by running the following command:
  ```shell
  $ oc get network.config cluster -o yaml
  ```
  The output displays only an IPv6 CIDR for the cluster network.

  Example output:
  ```text
  apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
  kind: Network
  metadata:
    name: cluster
  spec:
    clusterNetwork:
    - cidr: fd02::/48
      hostPrefix: 64
  ```

## Mitigation

It is recommended to use single stack IPv4 or a dual stack IPv4/IPv6 networking
to use OpenShift Virtualization .Refer the
[documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/converting-to-dual-stack.html).


------------------------------


Original Filename:  UnsupportedHCOModification.md

# UnsupportedHCOModification

## Meaning

This alert fires when a JSON Patch annotation is used to change an operand of
the HyperConverged Cluster Operator (HCO).

HCO configures OpenShift Virtualization and its supporting operators in an
opinionated way and
overwrites its operands when there is an unexpected change to them. Users must
not modify the operands directly.

However, if a change is required and it is not supported by the HCO API, you can
force HCO to set a change in an operator by using JSON Patch annotations. These
changes are not reverted by HCO during its reconciliation process.

## Impact

Incorrect use of JSON Patch annotations might lead to unexpected results or an
unstable environment.

Upgrading a system with JSON Patch annotations is dangerous because the
structure of the component custom resources might change.

## Diagnosis

Check the `annotation_name` in the alert details to identify the JSON Patch
annotation:

  ```text
  Labels
    alertname=UnsupportedHCOModification
    annotation_name=kubevirt.kubevirt.io/jsonpatch
    severity=info
  ```

## Mitigation

It is best to use the HCO API to change an operand. However, if the change can
only be done with a JSON Patch annotation, proceed with caution.

Remove JSON Patch annotations before upgrade to avoid potential issues.


------------------------------


Original Filename:  VMCannotBeEvicted.md

# VMCannotBeEvicted

## Meaning

This alert fires when the eviction strategy of a virtual machine (VM) is set to
`LiveMigration` but the VM is not migratable.

## Impact

Non-migratable VMs prevent node eviction. This condition affects operations such
as node drain and updates.

## Diagnosis

1. Check the VMI configuration to determine whether the value of
`evictionStrategy` is `LiveMigrate` of the VMI:

   ```bash
   $ oc get vmis -o yaml
   ```

2. Check for a `False` status in the `LIVE-MIGRATABLE` column to identify VMIs
that are not migratable:

   ```bash
   $ oc get vmis -o wide
   ```

3. Obtain the details of the VMI and check `spec.conditions` to identify the
issue:

   ```bash
   $ oc get vmi <vmi> -o yaml
   ```

   Example output:

   ```yaml
   status:
     conditions:
     - lastProbeTime: null
       lastTransitionTime: null
       message: cannot migrate VMI which does not use masquerade to connect to the pod network
       reason: InterfaceNotLiveMigratable
       status: "False"
       type: LiveMigratable
   ```

## Mitigation

Set the `evictionStrategy` of the VMI to `shutdown` or resolve the issue that
prevents the VMI from migrating.


------------------------------


Original Filename:  VMStorageClassWarning.md

# VMStorageClassWarning

## Meaning

When running VMs using ODF storage with 'rbd' mounter or 'rbd.csi.ceph.com'
provisioner, Windows VMs may cause reports of bad crc/signature errors due to
certain I/O patterns. Cluster performance can be severely degraded if the number
of re-transmissions due to crc errors causes network saturation. 'krbd:rxbounce'
should be configured for the VM storage class to prevent these crc errors, the
"ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization" storage class uses this option by
default, if available.

## Impact

Cluster may report a huge number of CRC errors and the cluster might experience
major service outages.

## Diagnosis

Obtain a list of VirtualMachines with an incorrectly configured storage class by
running the following PromQL query:

**Note:** You can use the Openshift metrics explorer available at
'https://{OPENSHIFT_BASE_URL}/monitoring/query-browser'.

```promql
$ kubevirt_ssp_vm_rbd_block_volume_without_rxbounce == 1
```

Example output:

```plaintext
kubevirt_ssp_vm_rbd_block_volume_without_rxbounce{name="testvmi-gwgdqp22k7", namespace="test_ns_1"} 1
kubevirt_ssp_vm_rbd_block_volume_without_rxbounce{name="testvmi-rjqbjg47a8", namespace="test_ns_2"} 1
```

The output displays a list of VirtualMachines that use a storage class without
`rxbounce_enabled`.

Obtain the VM volumes by running the following command:

```bash
$ oc get vm <vm-name> -o json | jq -r '.spec.template.spec.volumes[] | if .dataVolume then "DataVolume - " + .dataVolume.name elif .persistentVolumeClaim then "PersistentVolumeClaim - " + .persistentVolumeClaim.claimName else empty end'
```

## Mitigation

It is recommended to create a dedicated StorageClass with "krbd:rxbounce" map
option for the disks of virtual machines, to use a bounce buffer when receiving
data. The default behavior is to read directly into the destination buffer. A
bounce buffer is required if the stability of the destination buffer cannot be
guaranteed.

Note that changing the used storage class will not have any impact on existing
PVCs/VMs, meaning that new VMs will be provisioned with the optimized settings
but existing VMs need to be transitioned or the alert will continue to fire for
those.

```bash
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: vm-sc
parameters:
  # ...
  mounter: rbd
  mapOptions: "krbd:rxbounce"
provisioner: openshift-storage.rbd.csi.ceph.com
# ...
```

Original Filename:  VirtApiRESTErrorsBurst.md

# VirtApiRESTErrorsBurst

## Meaning

For the last 10 minutes or longer, over 80% of the REST calls made to `virt-api`
pods have failed.

## Impact

A very high rate of failed REST calls to `virt-api` might lead to slow response
and execution of API calls, and potentially to API calls being completely
dismissed.

However, currently running virtual machine workloads are not likely to be
affected.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. Obtain the list of `virt-api` pods on your deployment:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE get pods -l kubevirt.io=virt-api
   ```

3. Check the `virt-api` logs for error messages:

   ```bash
   $ oc logs -n $NAMESPACE <virt-api>
   ```

4. Obtain the details of the `virt-api` pods:

   ```bash
   $ oc describe -n $NAMESPACE <virt-api>
   ```

5. Check if any problems occurred with the nodes. For example, they might be in
a `NotReady` state:

   ```bash
   $ oc get nodes
   ```

6. Check the status of the `virt-api` deployment:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE get deploy virt-api -o yaml
   ```

7. Obtain the details of the `virt-api` deployment:

   ```bash

Original Filename:  VirtApiRESTErrorsHigh.md

# VirtApiRESTErrorsHigh

## Meaning

More than 5% of REST calls have failed in the `virt-api` pods in the last 60
minutes.

## Impact

A high rate of failed REST calls to `virt-api` might lead to slow response and
execution of API calls.

However, currently running virtual machine workloads are not likely to be
affected.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable as follows:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. Check the status of the `virt-api` pods:

Original Filename:  VirtControllerDown.md

# VirtControllerDown

## Meaning
No running `virt-controller` pod has been detected for 5 minutes.

## Impact
Any actions related to virtual machine (VM) lifecycle management fail. This
notably includes launching a new virtual machine instance (VMI) or shutting down
an existing VMI.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. Check the status of the `virt-controller` deployment:

   ```bash
   $ oc get deployment -n $NAMESPACE virt-controller -o yaml
   ```

3. Review the logs of the `virt-controller` pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc get logs <virt-controller>
   ```

## Mitigation

This alert can have a variety of causes, including the following:

- Node resource exhaustion
- Not enough memory on the cluster
- Nodes are down
- The API server is overloaded. For example, the scheduler might be under a
heavy load and therefore not completely available.
- Networking issues

Identify the root cause and fix it, if possible.

Original Filename:  VirtControllerRESTErrorsBurst.md

# VirtControllerRESTErrorsBurst

## Meaning

For the last 10 minutes or longer, over 80% of the REST calls made to
`virt-controller` pods have failed.

The `virt-controller` has likely fully lost the connection to the API server.

This error is frequently caused by one of the following problems:

- The API server is overloaded, which causes timeouts. To verify if this is the
case, check the metrics of the API server, and view its response times and
overall calls.

- The `virt-controller` pod cannot reach the API server. This is commonly caused
by DNS issues on the node and networking connectivity issues.

## Impact

Status updates are not propagated and actions like migrations cannot take place.
However, running workloads are not impacted.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. List the available `virt-controller` pods:

   ```bash
   $ oc get pods -n $NAMESPACE -l=kubevirt.io=virt-controller
   ```

3. Check the `virt-controller` logs for error messages when connecting to the
API server:

   ```bash
   $ oc logs -n $NAMESPACE <virt-controller>
   ```

## Mitigation

- If the `virt-controller` pod cannot connect to the API server, delete the pod
to force a restart:

  ```bash
  $ oc delete -n $NAMESPACE <virt-controller>
  ```

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,

------------------------------


Original Filename:  VirtControllerRESTErrorsHigh.md

# VirtControllerRESTErrorsHigh

## Meaning

More than 5% of REST calls failed in `virt-controller` in the last 60 minutes.

This is most likely because `virt-controller` has partially lost connection to
the API server.

This error is frequently caused by one of the following problems:

- The API server is overloaded, which causes timeouts. To verify if this is the
case, check the metrics of the API server, and view its response times and
overall calls.

- The `virt-controller` pod cannot reach the API server. This is commonly caused
by DNS issues on the node and networking connectivity issues.

## Impact

Node-related actions, such as starting and migrating, and scheduling virtual
machines, are delayed. Running workloads are not affected, but reporting their
current status might be delayed.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. List the available `virt-controller` pods:

   ```bash
   $ oc get pods -n $NAMESPACE -l=kubevirt.io=virt-controller
   ```

3. Check the `virt-controller` logs for error messages when connecting to the
API server:

   ```bash
   $ oc logs -n $NAMESPACE <virt-controller>
   ```

## Mitigation

- If the `virt-controller` pod cannot connect to the API server, delete the pod
to force a restart:

## Impact

This alert is a warning. It does not indicate that all `virt-handler` daemon
sets have failed to deploy. Therefore, the normal lifecycle of virtual machines
is not affected unless the cluster is overloaded.

## Diagnosis

Identify worker nodes that do not have a running `virt-handler` pod:

1. Export the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. Check the status of the `virt-handler` pods to identify pods that have not
deployed:

   ```bash
   $ oc get pods -n $NAMESPACE -l=kubevirt.io=virt-handler
   ```

3. Obtain the name of the worker node of the `virt-handler` pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE get pod <virt-handler> -o jsonpath='{.spec.nodeName}'
   ```

## Mitigation

If the `virt-handler` pods failed to deploy because of insufficient resources,
you can delete other pods on the affected worker node.

Original Filename:  VirtHandlerRESTErrorsBurst.md

# VirtHandlerRESTErrorsBurst

## Meaning

For the last 10 minutes or longer, over 80% of the REST calls made to
`virt-handler` pods have failed.

This alert usually indicates that the `virt-handler` pods cannot connect to the
API server.

This error is frequently caused by one of the following problems:

- The API server is overloaded, which causes timeouts. To verify if this is the
case, check the metrics of the API server, and view its response times and
overall calls.

- The `virt-handler` pod cannot reach the API server. This is commonly caused by
DNS issues on the node and networking connectivity issues.

## Impact

Status updates are not propagated and node-related actions, such as migrations,
fail. However, running workloads on the affected node are not impacted.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. Check the status of the `virt-handler` pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc get pods -n $NAMESPACE -l=kubevirt.io=virt-handler
   ```

3. Check the `virt-handler` logs for error messages when connecting to the API
server:

   ```bash
   $ oc logs -n $NAMESPACE <virt-handler>
   ```

## Mitigation

- If the `virt-handler` cannot connect to the API server, delete the pod to
force a restart:

  ```bash
  $ oc delete -n $NAMESPACE <virt-handler>
  ```

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,
attaching the artifacts gathered during the diagnosis procedure.

Original Filename:  VirtHandlerRESTErrorsHigh.md

# VirtHandlerRESTErrorsHigh

## Meaning

More than 5% of REST calls failed in `virt-handler` in the last 60 minutes. This
alert usually indicates that the `virt-handler` pods have partially lost
connection to the API server.

This error is frequently caused by one of the following problems:

- The API server is overloaded, which causes timeouts. To verify if this is the
case, check the metrics of the API server, and view its response times and
overall calls.

- The `virt-handler` pod cannot reach the API server. This is commonly caused by
DNS issues on the node and networking connectivity issues.

## Impact

Node-related actions, such as starting and migrating workloads, are delayed on
the node that `virt-handler` is running on. Running workloads are not affected,
but reporting their current status might be delayed.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. List the available `virt-handler` pods to identify the failing `virt-handler`
pod:

   ```bash
   $ oc get pods -n $NAMESPACE -l=kubevirt.io=virt-handler
   ```

3. Check the failing `virt-handler` pod log for error messages when connecting
to the API server:

   ```bash
   $ oc logs -n $NAMESPACE <virt-handler>
   ```

   Example error message:

   ```json
   {"component":"virt-handler","level":"error","msg":"Can't patch node my-node","pos":"heartbeat.go:96","reason":"the server has received too many API requests and has asked us to try again later","timestamp":"2023-11-06T11:11:41.099883Z","uid":"132c50c2-8d82-4e49-8857-dc737adcd6cc"}
   ```

## Mitigation

If the `virt-handler` cannot connect to the API server, delete the pod to force
a restart:

```bash
$ oc delete -n $NAMESPACE <virt-handler>
```

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,

Original Filename:  VirtOperatorDown.md

# VirtOperatorDown

## Meaning

This alert fires when no `virt-operator` pod in the `Running` state has been
detected for 10 minutes.

The `virt-operator` is the first Operator to start in a cluster. Its primary
responsibilities include the following:

- Installing, live-updating, and live-upgrading a cluster
- Monitoring the life cycle of top-level controllers, such as `virt-controller`,
`virt-handler`, `virt-launcher`, and managing their reconciliation
- Certain cluster-wide tasks, such as certificate rotation and infrastructure
management

The `virt-operator` deployment has a default replica of 2 pods.

## Impact

This alert indicates a failure at the level of the cluster. Critical
cluster-wide management functionalities, such as certification rotation,
upgrade, and reconciliation of controllers, might not be available.

The `virt-operator` is not directly responsible for virtual machines (VMs) in
the cluster. Therefore, its temporary unavailability does not significantly
affect VM workloads.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. Check the status of the `virt-operator` deployment:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE get deploy virt-operator -o yaml
   ```

3. Obtain the details of the `virt-operator` deployment:

   ```bash
   $ oc -n $NAMESPACE describe deploy virt-operator
   ```

4. Check the status of the `virt-operator` pods:

   ```bash
   $ oc get pods -n $NAMESPACE -l=kubevirt.io=virt-operator
   ```

5. Check for node issues, such as a `NotReady` state:

   ```bash
   $ oc get nodes
   ```

## Mitigation

Based on the information obtained during the diagnosis procedure, try to
identify the root cause and resolve the issue.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,
attaching the artifacts gathered during the diagnosis procedure.
